Transformations on Pair RDD
***************************

• Pair RDDs are allowed to use all the transformations available to regular
  RDDs, and thus support the same functions as regular RDDs.
• Since pair RDDs contain tuples, we need to pass functions that operate on
  tuples rather than on individual elements.
