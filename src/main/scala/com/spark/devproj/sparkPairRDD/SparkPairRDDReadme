Pair RDD
********8

A Pair RDDs is a particular type of RDD that can store key-value pairs.


• A lot of datasets we see in real life examples are usually key value pairs.
• Examples:
    – A dataset which contains passport IDs and the names of the passport holders.
    – A dataset contains course names and a list of students that enrolled in the courses.
• The typical pattern of this kind of dataset is that is each row is one key maps to one value
  or multiple values.
• Spark provides a data structure called Pair RDD instead of regular RDDs,which makes working with
  this kind of data more simpler and more efficient.
• A Pair RDDs is a particular type of RDD that can store key-value pairs.
• Pair RDDs are useful building blocks in many spark programs.
