Broadcast Variables:
*******************
• Broadcast variables allow the programmer to keep a readonly variable cached on each machine rather
  than shipping a copy of it with tasks.
• They can be used, for example, to give every node, a copy of a large input dataset, in an efficient
  manner.
• All broadcast variables will be kept at all the worker nodes for use in one or more Spark operations.

Procedures of using Broadcast Variables
• Create a Broadcast variable T by calling SparkContext.broadcast() on an object of type T.
– The Broadcast variable can be any type as long as it’s serializable because the broadcast needs
  to passed from the driver program to all the worker in the Spark cluster across the wire.
• The variable will be sent to each node only once and should be treated as read-only, meaning
  updates will not be propagated to other nodes.
• The value of the broadcast can be accessed by calling the value method in each node.
