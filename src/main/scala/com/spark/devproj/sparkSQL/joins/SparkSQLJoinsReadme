Spark SQL join Vs Core Spark join
#########################################################################################

Spark SQL supports the same basic join types as core spark.
Spark SQL Catalyst Optimizer can do more of the heavy lifting for us to optimize the join performance.
Using Spark SQL join, we have to give up some of our control.
For Example: Spark SQL can sometimes push down or re-order operations to make the joins more efficient.
The downside is that we don't have controls over the partitioner for Datasets, so we can't
manually avoid shuffles as we did with spark core joins.
