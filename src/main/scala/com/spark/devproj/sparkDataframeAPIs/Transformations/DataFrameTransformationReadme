Working with DataFrame Row:

We have two types of methods to Transform the data.

1. High-Level Methods.
2. Low-Level Methods.


- We use High-level methods when your DataFrame got Schema.
- When DataFrame don't have structure we use Low-level methods because we don't have
  column so will process the Row itself.
